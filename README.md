Based on the data from the usage of a mobile application for food product sales,
analyze the sales funnel and evaluate the results of A/A/B testing.



In this project, I have studied the principles of event analytics. I constructed a sales funnel, 
investigated the user journey to purchase, and analyzed the results of an A/B 
test for the introduction of new fonts. I compared two control groups to ensure correct traffic 
allocation and then compared them to the test group. It was found that the new font had a minimal 
impact on user behavior.
